# An Image Summarization and  Q & A system for sports domain using Image Classification.
This is the project done as a part of course work for Big Data analytica and Applications for the Spring semester 2017 at University of Missouri Kansas City.
This is an application develpded by implementing various imgae classification algorithms. Given an image this application gives prediction about image the image class and gives summary in the form of captions.  We used Decision Trees and Random Forests for Image classification algorithms and Show and tell model for Generating Captions.  
We also built a Convolutional Neural Net by retraining the final layer of Inception V4 model for Image Classification. Also, we built a simple convesation app using API.AI where a user can ask some questions about sports and get information about it.
